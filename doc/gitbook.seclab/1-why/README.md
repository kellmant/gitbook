# Why do this?

Why are we here?

There is a constraint in the business.  Pain points may include:

* Inability to make infrastructure changes to the firewall, routing tables or local ACL in a timely manner.  Using elastic compute can add hundreds of new services to a system in minutes, or remove instances just as quickly.  Updating infrastructure to take these new instances into account has to be done using automation.

* Creating new environments for customers or developers may be a challenge.   Some common use cases for multiple environments are for A|B testing (Also known as Green and Blue testing, or Red and Black Testing), a development environment, User Acceptance Testing (UAT) for a new version or for specific customers.  Defining service mappings that are centrally managed and automatically deployed can resolve these issues.

* Implementing changes so that the change that was approved was the change that was deployed.  The drive to implement business logic rules that allow a server to be put on-line automatically when it is created and meets specific criteria.

* Having the systems and software work together between Operations, Developers, Security and Audit by integrating and logging the who/what/when/where/how into common tools that everyone can access.  Will ease compliance with PCI, SOX, COBIT or whatever framework they are following as part of the programatic expression of infrastructure.

Some common triggers of discussion.

| Discussion | Notes |
|:----|:----|
| Velocity of Change | Change control, approval and authorization of dynamic services|
| Risk vs Compliance | Conflicting compliance requirements under changing risk models|
| DevOps | Security impacting the automation or devops deployment models |
| Machine Learning | How do you manage data analytics at scale? How do you protect not just the data, but the results? |
